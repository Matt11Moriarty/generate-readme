# Readme Generator

## Description

I created this project to be used as a quick and easy way to generate a readme.md file for your project!
Readme files can be time consuming to create manually, so by automating some of the processes, a well formatted and convenient readme can be generate hassle free.

In building this generator, I became very familiar with fundamenal Node.js concepts such as modularization, and leveraging npm's (fs and inquirer specifically).
